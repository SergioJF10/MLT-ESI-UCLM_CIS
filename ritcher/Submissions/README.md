# Submissions' Folder
In this folder we will be adding all the submissions we made along the development process of the project. We will indicate for each submission several things: (i) the **date**, (ii) the **name of the .csv** submitted, (iii) **brief explanation** about what is the content of each one; and (iv) the Driven Data **score** obtained.
