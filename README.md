# MLT-ESI-UCLM_CIS
Repository for the Machine Learning Techniques subject assignments (4th grade, Escuela Superior de Inform√°tica, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha).
This repository is divided in two main parts:

1. `worldcup`: In this folder, we can find both the data and the Google Colab notebook for the **Unsupervised Learning** task of the first part of the subject. More specifically there is two Google Colab notebooks: (i) Feature Selection, and (ii) Process and Clustering techniques. Also, we find the dataset with a total of 32 registers and 76 features per each team.
    - *Task*: There were three main tasks in this deliverable: (i) perform an adequate **feature selection** in order to reduce the number of features, though improving the next stage; (ii) **clustering** all the teams and give the corresponding explanations of each cluste; and, finally, (iii)  **interpret** the obtain results as a whole conclussion.
    - *Files*: The folder contains the following files:

        1. `Task_Study_WorldCup2018.ipynb`: Processing and Clustering application to the selected features.
        2. `worldcup_2018_final_data.csv`: Dataset with the 32 teams and 76 features each.
        3. `WORLDCUP_Feature_Selection.ipynb`: Feature Selection process applying both, feature clustering techniques and domain knowledge.
    - *Last Update*: 1st November 2022.

2. `ritcher`: In this folder, we would find all the Google Colab notebooks, pdf reports for the study and data necessary for the **Supervised Learning** Classification tasks.
