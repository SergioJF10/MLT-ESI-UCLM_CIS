# MLT-ESI-UCLM_CIS
Repository for the Machine Learning Techniques subject assignments (4th grade, Escuela Superior de Inform√°tica, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha).

## Projects üìë
In this repository we include all the needed and generated files for the development of three different projects applying Machine Learning techniques. Those projects are:

1. [**TASK 2.1**] [`worldcup`](https://github.com/SergioJF10/MLT-ESI-UCLM_CIS/tree/main/worldcup=): In this folder, we can find both the data and the Google Colab notebook for the **Unsupervised Learning** task of the first part of the subject. More specifically there is two Google Colab notebooks: (i) Feature Selection, and (ii) Process and Clustering techniques. Also, we find the dataset with a total of 32 registers and 76 features per each team.
    - *Task*: There were three main tasks in this deliverable: (i) perform an adequate **feature selection** in order to reduce the number of features, though improving the next stage; (ii) **clustering** all the teams and give the corresponding explanations of each cluste; and, finally, (iii)  **interpret** the obtain results as a whole conclussion.

2. [**TASK 2.2**] [`ritcher`](https://github.com/SergioJF10/MLT-ESI-UCLM_CIS/tree/main/ritcher): In this folder, we would find all the Google Colab notebook, pdf reports for the study and data necessary for the **Supervised Learning** Classification tasks. For this project only one Google Colab notebook was used with the development for the whole project correctly explained.
    - *Task*: The main task for this project was to build a model that predicts the value of a categorical label (damage grade) that represents the level of damage that the earthquake caused over a given building. This damage grade variable can have three values: (i) Level 1, low damage; (ii) Level 2, medium amount of damage; (iii) Level 3, almost complete destruction.

3. [**TASK 2.3**] [`products`](https://github.com/SergioJF10/MLT-ESI-UCLM_CIS/tree/main/products): In this folder, we include all the files and reports from the project of trying to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for another **Supervised Learning** Classification task. Again, for this case, we only needed, as source code, one Google Colab Notebook.
    - *Task*: For this project we were asked to build a model that, given an opinion for a certain product as well as its summary, try to predict the score that the client gave to it. In other words, we are talking about a classification task, since we have to try to classify how satisfied was the client with the product: (i) Totaly unsatisfied, (ii) Unsatisfied, (iii) Only good enough, (iv) Satisfied, (v) Hugely satisfied.

In each project's folder, you can find a README.md file with all the pertinent explanations and summaries of the project.

## Used Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
For all these three projects the main technology used are [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/?hl=es) Notebooks. By this way, we could keep on developing as well as reporting our projects in the same file.

We also took as inspiration for the inner project folders the file structuring principles from the [CookieCutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) project for Machine Learning and Data Mining projects.
