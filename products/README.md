# Worldcup Project
## Task üìã
This task was related with Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and techniques, corresponding with the laboratory part of this subject. Regarding the deriverable, the problem was divided in these main parts:

1. Preprocessing.
2. Vectorization.
3. Feature Selection.
4. Classification Algorithms.

The main goal is to obtain several models that, given an text with an opinion for a product, the model predicts the score that user will give to the product (from 1 to 5).

## Files üóÉÔ∏è
This folder includes the following structure:
- `Data`: Needed for the NLP process.
    - `Raw`: With the original _products.csv_ dataset.
    - `Interim`: With json files with data preprocessed and transformed according to NLP techniques.
- `Models`: With the best model from all the obtained ones.
- `Notebooks`: All the relevant Google Colab Notebooks.
    - `Models`: Colab Notebooks with the Vectorization and Model obtaining steps, for 4 different approaches.
    - `NLP`: Colab Notebook with the preprocessing and transformation steps according to NLP techniques and concepts.
- `Reports`: Extra information for firther explanations.
    - `Figures`: Final helpfull images for explanations.
- `Scripts`: With several scripts for local executions of some vectorization and model obtaining steps. Including also the _requirements.txt_ file (**instructions inside** the folder).

## Development üíª
All these developmentes are properly documented and coded in the `Notebooks` folder.

Mainly we have two parts for this project: preprocessing/transformation and vectorization/model obtaining.

### Preprocessing / Transformation

### Vectorization & Model Obtaining

## Results üí°
